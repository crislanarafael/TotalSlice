# **2. Intro & Goal**

Being able to manage money well is an important life skill that can help people create a better future for themselves. However, I find budgeting overwhelming and only seeing dollar amounts doesn't give me a clear picture of where my money is going. Total Slice aims to make budgeting simpler by providing visualization of the user's monthly budget and expenses so they can better see where their money goes. This knowledge can help users determine how they can reduce their spending and save money for important things like emergency funds or tuition costs.

# 3. Who is it for?

Anyone interested in better managing their personal spending and budgeting who might find that pure numbers don't click for them and need to visualize it

# 4. Why Build It?

I'm currently looking at paying tuition for my fall semester and I was interested a tool that can help me visualize my expenses and leftover funds because I find it hard to wrap my head around dollar amounts - I'm a visual learner and seeing numbers by itself doesn't give me a clear picture of my money. I think that it would help others who are more visually inclined as well.
